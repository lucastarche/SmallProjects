# EndoderV2

A simple file (but fast) file encryptor by using an XOR One-Time Pad.
Because of this, it will double the size of the original file, since it makes the encrypted file plus a key, which is also the size of the original file.

Do not ask about the original Encoder. You don't want to know about it. Trust me.
